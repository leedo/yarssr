Yarssr, a RSS reader for the GNOME Tray
Author: Lee Aylward <lee@laylward.com>

Perl Module requirements:

XML::RSS
Gtk2 (http://gtk2-perl.sf.net)
Gtk2::GladeXML
Gtk2::TrayIcon
Gnome2::VFS 
Gnome2 >= 0.94 

Check INSTALL file for installation directions.

Just run 'yarssr'. Wait while it retrieves the RSS feeds,
and then displays them in the tray. Preferences allows you
to add feeds and adjust the interval time.

If you have problems upgrading from an old version of Yarssr, it is
recommended that you delete your ~/.yarssr directory.

Improvements welcome.
